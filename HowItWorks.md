---

## 2. Application Scope <a name="Chapter2"></a>
The WFI32-IoT-IoT development board has been created with the intention of demostrating a one source solution for evaluation of existing cloud provider solutions. 
This example end-device leverages the catalog of devices, and libraries provided through Microchip's extensive product line to showcase a basic Internet of Things product connection. Data exchange between server and in field device is implemented using on board sensors for temperature and light value observations. Behavior actions are demonstrated through visual indication of the 'Data' LED as controlled through the Web based APIs. 

General Out-Of-Box operation is as described below:
1. Use the WFI32E01PC single-chip WiFi module to establish local WiFi connection to Router/Switch or Network source. The **Blue 'Wi-Fi' LED** is used to indicate this status. 
2. The on-module ATECC608A HSM is used to establishe a Secure (TLS) Socket Connection with select Cloud Provider using a TCP connection. The **Green 'Connect' LED** is used to indicate this status
3. Using **AWS C SDK**, data is exchanged between client (end-device) and broker (cloud). 
4. Sensor Data is sent as Telemetry Data between device and broker at a periodic rate of 1 Second. The **Yellow 'Data' LED** blinks to indicate this status. 
5. Capture of Data sent from Broker to Device can be observed through a Serial terminal when USB-Micro is connected to WFI32-IoT board. 
6. Behavior variation can be observed on the 'Data' LED when triggered through the web based API and sent through the broker to end device.

**Note**: The **SW1 & SW2** user buttons have no effect outside of variation of start-up operation where:
* **SW1** held during boot-up: Enter Soft AP mode.
* **SW1 & SW2** held during boot-up: Use factory default configuration. Default Wi-Fi credentials are {**MCHP.IOT, microchip**}

**Note**: The **Red 'Data' LED** remaining on may indicate a hardware fault.

## 5. Secure Provisioning & Transport Layer Security <a name="Chapter5"></a>

1. The WFI32-IoT board is shipped pre-provisioned for coordination with the AWS Cloud system.
2. Security is achieved by using the WolfSSL Transport Layer Security (TLS) stack configured within Harmony 3 eco-system.
3. A Pre-Manufacturing process has configured the appropriate slot locations on the ATECC608A HSM.
4. All required certificates used for signing and authentication have been written to and 'locked' into allocated slots.
	* This process is achieved through: [Trust&Go](https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/security-ics/trust-platform/trust-go)
	* Full scope of support for Secure Aspects of development can be found here: [Trust Platform](https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/security-ics/trust-platform)
5. This process has been performed to allow for an Out Of Box (OOB) operation of the WFI32-IoT board along with supporting web page.
6. Shadow Topic are a key application feature being supported through WFI32-IoT demo. Further reference can be found here: [Shadow MQTT Topics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/device-shadow-mqtt.html)

---

## 6. Understanding the Device Shadow in AWS <a name="Chapter6"></a>

1. The AWS broker allows for the use of Shadow Topics. The Shadow Topics are used to retain a specific value within the Broker, so End-Device status updates can be managed.
 	* Shadow Topics are used to restore the state of variables, or applications.
	* Shadow Topics retain expected values, and report if Published data reflects a difference in value.
	* When difference exist, status of the delta is reported to those subscribed to appropriate topic messages.

2. Updates to the device shadow are published on ``$aws/things/{thingName}/shadow/update`` topic.  When a message is sent to the board by changing the value of the **toggle** button in **Control Your Device** section:
	* This message is published on the ``$aws/things/{thingName}/shadow/update topic``. 
	* If the published value of **toggle** is different from the **toggle** value present in the AWS Device Shadow, the AWS Shadow service reports this change to the device by publishing a message on ``$aws/things/{thingName}/shadow/update/delta`` topic.
	* The JSON structure of the message sent should appear as below
	```json
	{
	  "state": {
	    "desired": {
	      "toggle": toBeUpdatedToggleValue
	    }
	  }
	}
	```
3. The meta data, and delta difference will be reported via the Serial Terminal upon a difference between desired/reported.

<img src="resources/media/HowItWorks/understandingDeviceShadow2.png" width=720/>

4. In response to this, the end device publishes a message to ``$aws/things/{thingName}/shadow/update`` topic.
	* This message is published to **report** the update to the **toggle** attribute.
	* The JSON structure of the message sent should appear as below
	```json
	{
	  "state": {
	    "reported": {
	      "toggle": updatedToggleValue
	    }
	  }
	}
	```

21. You will be able to observe periodic temperature and light data coming into the console from your device.

22. To control the **Yellow LED**, publish the following message:

	* topic: ``$aws/things/<thingName>/shadow/update``
	* payload:
	```json
	{
	  "state":
	  {
	       "desired":
	       {
		     "toggle": toBeUpdatedToggleValue
	       }
	  }
	}
	```

23. Depending on the value of **toggle**, the **Yellow LED** will be on/off for 2 seconds.

5. **Browse** your PC to load the downloaded hex file into IPE.
6. Click on **Program** in the IPE and wait for device programming to complete.

---

### 9. Code generation using Harmony 3 <a name="Chapter9"></a>

To add additional features to the OOB demo, you might have to regenerate the demo code using Harmony3 after adding additional components or changing the existing configuration.
Ensure that you use the same version or Harmony 3 components used in the original demo codebase while regenerating code. You can see the version dependencies of the demo in `harmony-manifest-success.yml` file found at `WFI32-IoT\demo\cloud_sdk_demo\firmware\src\config\aws_sdk_wfi32_iot_freertos` into Harmony3 content manager. 

In case of a mismatch between the Harmony 3 components present in the demo and the ones available in disk, Harmony3 Configurator will popup a warning screen during launch. In the case of the sample shown below, the `Wireless` component available in disk is older `3.3.1` while the version used in the project is `3.4.0`. 

<p align="center">
<img src="resources/media/HowItWorks/mh3_mismatch.PNG" width=480/>
</p>

It is recommended to use the same versions used in the project while regenerating the project. 

To sync your Harmony3 setup to match the versions used in the demo, follow these steps:

1. Open Harmony3 Content manager
2. Navigate to `Local Packages` and click on `Load manifest file`

3. When you select the project manifest file, the required versions of Harmony3 dependencies will be checked out by content manager.

4. Close content manager and open the Harmony configurator to continue.


<p align="center">
<img src="resources/media/HowItWorks/cm_local_repo.png" width=480/>
</p>

While generating code, make sure that you use “USER_ALL” merge strategy.

The default demo code includes some changes to the generated “net_pres_enc_glue.c” file. Make sure that you retain the changes shown in the images below during code generation. These changes are to enable support for ECC608 TNGTLS in the TLS flow. If the right dependencies are loaded, there should not be any additional merges while regenerating code without any configuration change.

### 10. Debugging <a name="Chapter10"></a>
When connecting WFI32-IoT board to a PC using a standard micro-USB cable, it enumerates as a USB MSD (Mass Storage Device) in addition to two other virtual COM ports reflecting UART1 and UART3 of the module where:
* UART1 is used for application debug logs.
* UART3 is used for Wi-Fi FW and AWS C SDK logs.

UART1 supports a set of user commands via command line as follows:
1. "**rssi**" command: prints current connection RSSI value.
2. "**unixtime**" command: prints current UNIX time.
3. "**debug <debug_level>**": sets application debug level (accepted values are 0 through 4).

**Note**: UART1 and UART3 settings should be 115200 8N1.
